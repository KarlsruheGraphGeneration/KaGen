/*!
 * ThreadPool starts a fixed number p of std::threads which process Jobs that
 * are \ref enqueue "enqueued" into a concurrent job queue. The jobs
 * themselves can enqueue more jobs that will be processed when a thread is
 * ready.
 *
 * The ThreadPool can either run until
 *
 * 1. all jobs are done AND all threads are idle, when called with
 * loop_until_empty(), or
 *
 * 2. until Terminate() is called when run with loop_until_terminate().
 *
 * Jobs are plain tlx::Delegate<void()> objects, hence the pool user must pass
 * in ALL CONTEXT himself. The best method to pass parameters to Jobs is to use
 * lambda captures. Alternatively, old-school objects implementing operator(),
 * or std::binds can be used.
 *
 * The ThreadPool uses a condition variable to wait for new jobs and does not
 * remain busy waiting.
 *
 * Note that the threads in the pool start **before** the two loop functions are
 * called. In case of loop_until_empty() the threads continue to be idle
 * afterwards, and can be reused, until the ThreadPool is destroyed.
